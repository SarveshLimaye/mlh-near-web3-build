## TokenGate 

TokenGate is an NFT ticketing platform that addresses the issue of ticket duplication for events. We offer a seamless onboarding experience by implementing Polybase for social authentication, ensuring inclusivity for web2 users without wallet addresses. Event organizers can add their events, and each event goes through an approval process by admins before being listed on the platform

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡

Traditional ticketing systems have long been plagued by issues such as fraudulent tickets, scalping, and lack of control over personal data. These challenges have not only impacted event organizers but have also led to frustrations for attendees. TokenGate aims to address these pain points and create a better, more inclusive ticketing experience for all.
